IntelliCommand
==============

IntelliCommand is a Visual Studio extension that helps you use keyboard shortcuts. It started as a hackathon project by a few devs on the Visual Studio team at Microsoft.

This extension is supported on Visual Studio 2010, 2012, and 2013 on Professional and higher.

You can get the latest working version from the [Visual Studio Gallery][1].

The basics
----
IntelliCommand shows a helpful overlay window with all of the possible shortcuts you can use when you press Ctrl, Shift, Alt or any combination of those keys (hold the keys for 2 seconds to see the window). It also supports multi-key shortcut chords, so when you press the first key in a multi-key shortcut (like Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C), it shows you the possible next keys you can press and what they do.
